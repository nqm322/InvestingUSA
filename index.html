   <h1>Investing in the U.S.</h1>
   <p class="startOfArt">Welcome to my article, today we are gonna talk about investing in USA.</p>
   <p>SelectUSA is a U.S. government-wide program led by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Its mission is to facilitate job-creating business investment into the United States and raise awareness of the critical role that foreign direct investment (FDI) plays in the U.S. economy. SelectUSA is designed to complement the activities of our states—the primary drivers of economic development in the United States.</p>
   <h2>Attracting Investment, Increasing Employment</h2>
   <p>On the SelectUSA website, state economic development agencies and businesses — foreign and domestic — will find the information they need to better understand the complete value proposition offered to firms located in the United States.</p>
   <h2>U.S. Cluster Mapping Tool</h2>
   <p>When you think of business and investment opportunities in the United States, where’s the best place to start?   America is made up of 50 states plus territories and each location has its own unique economic profile.
The free, online Cluster Mapping tool uses more than 50 million data records to help you identify industry regional clusters and make informed investment decisions.</p>
<h2>Global Entry – Skip the Queues</h2>
<p>The U.S. Global Entry system allows for expedited clearance of pre-approved, low-risk travelers.
    Currently available at 49 U.S. airports and 13 preclearance locations, Global Entry streamlines the screening process at airports for trusted travelers. Global Entry members bypass the traditional CBP inspection lines and use an automated kiosk to complete their admission to the United States. The program has enrolled more than 3 million members, and CBP receives approximately 100,000 new applications for Global Entry each month. As an added benefit, Global Entry members are also eligible to participate in the TSA Pre✓™expedited screening program.</p>
